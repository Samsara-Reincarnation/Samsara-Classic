# Samsara Classic
Samsara Classic is a gameplay modification for ZDoom, GZDoom, and Zandronum that brings the protaganists of retro first-person shooters into the Doom engine. Samsara Classic is based off of Kinsie's [fork](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1iDp2UZTDreRW40NXJJQVE1Unc/view?usp=sharing) of Samsara, which was released in 2013 by [TerminusEst13](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/TerminusEst13).

Samsara Classic is similar to Samsara Reincarnation, another fork based off of the original version of Samsara that adds additional characters, features, and enemy sets. Although both mods are made by the same team, Classic takes a far more conservative and strict approach to updating the mod since its last update in 2016. There are no additional characters, but there are bugfixes and a few gameplay settings added in.

This fork is targeted for players who prefer the older versions of Samsara compared to Reincarnation or those who are unable to run Reincarnation but wish to experience an updated version of Samsara.
